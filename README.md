1. Run the the file on Windows with : "python main.py"
(I'm assuming you already have Python 3 installed)

OR with : "python3 main.py" for Mac or Linux (if you don't have alias for default "python3")
(if you have an alias for python3, use what you've named accordingly with main.py, users normally prefer "python" for uniformity, use "python main.py" for the alternative)

2. No external libraries used. A standard Python installation works fine.

3. Run: "python tests.py" (for unittest for this solution)
