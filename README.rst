You will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.1+ - https://python.org
- No external Python libraries used. A standard Python installation works fine.
- Git - https://git-scm.com/

   .. code:: sh

        git clone https://github.com/otuozeAhmed/data2bots.git

**Step - 2. Change diectory.**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. code:: sh

        cd data2bots
***

**Step - 3. Run the project. (Windows)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. code:: sh

        python main.py 
***

**Step - 3a. Run the project. (Mac or Linux)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. code:: sh

        python3 main.py
***

- if you don't have alias for default "python3"


**Step - 4. Run the tests. (Mac or Linux)**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. code:: sh

        python tests.py
***








# Getting Started
1. Run the the file on Windows with : "python main.py"
(I'm assuming you already have Python 3 installed)

OR with : "python3 main.py" for Mac or Linux (if you don't have alias for default "python3")
(if you have an alias for python3, use what you've named accordingly with main.py, users normally prefer "python" for uniformity, use "python main.py" for the alternative)

2. 

3. Run: "python tests.py" (for unittest for this solution)
